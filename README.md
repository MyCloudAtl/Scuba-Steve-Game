**Lets Play Scuba-Steve**
1. Object: Help Scuba Steve guess the secret word before he gains too many heads. Each letter guessed will be evaluated as truthy/falsy.
1. Players: Players can take turns or work together. Gameplay continues until the players guess the word or they run out of guesses and the heads have constructed their figure.
Guesses will be logged letter by letter.
The previous falsy letters guessed will not be logged; to increase difficultly for the player and help build mental recall.
Start guessing letters if you are the player. 
***Example:*** ``` “Is there an 'a' in the word?” ```
The letter will fill in the  appropriate blanks if the players guess correctly/truthy. 
*Whenever a player guesses a letter that is falsy in the secret word, they will receive a skull that brings them closer to losing and constructing their END.*
The player wins when they correctly build the secret word. If the players get every letter of the word before the skulls build the END; they've won. 
>This is a letter by letter game. So fill in the blanks individually guessing the whole word at once will not be logged.
