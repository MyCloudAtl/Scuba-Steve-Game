**Lets Play Scuba-Steve**
1. Object: The object of hangman is to guess the secret word before the stick figure is hung. Players take turns selecting letters to narrow the word down.
1. Players: Players can take turns or work together. Gameplay continues until the players guess the word or they run out of guesses and the stick figure is hung.
The other players will need to guess your word letter by letter.
Start guessing letters if you are the player. You can have each player take turns or have the players work together and choose letters as a group. 
***Example:*** ``` “Is there an 'a' in the word?” ```
Fill the letter in the blanks if the players guess correctly. Whenever a player guesses a letter that is in the secret word, the host fills in the relevant blank.
*Whenever a player guesses a letter that is not in the secret word, they get a strike that brings them closer to losing.*
The players win when they guess the correct word. If the players get every letter of the word before the host finishes drawing then they win. 
>At any point a player can try to guess the entire word instead of a single letter, but if they guess the wrong word then the host should treat it as if they guessed a wrong letter.
