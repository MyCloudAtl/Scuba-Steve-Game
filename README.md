# Lets Play Scuba-Steve
Object: Help Scuba Steve guess the secret word before he gains too many heads. Each letter guessed will be evaluated as truthy/falsy till the game results in a win or a loss.
## How to Play
1. Players can take turns or work together. 

>Gameplay continues until the players guess the word or they run out of guesses and the heads have constructed their figure.

2. Guesses will be logged letter by letter.

>The previous falsy letters guessed will not be logged; to increase difficultly for the player and help build mental recall.

3. Start guessing letters if you are the player. 

***Example:*** ``` “Is there an 'a' in the word?” ```

4. The letter will fill in the  appropriate blanks if the players guess correctly/truthy. 

>Whenever a player guesses a letter that is falsy in the secret word, they will receive a skull that brings them closer to losing and constructing their END.***

5. The player wins when they correctly build the secret word. If the players get every letter of the word before the skulls build the END; they've won. 

***This is a letter by letter game. So fill in the blanks individually guessing the whole word at once will not be logged.***
